# Sudoku Solver

Jannik Kreucher

## About
This is a simple sudoku solver using the method of backtracking. Backtracking is using recursive function calls to find a correct solution. When a mistake is made the algorithm goes back to the last valid state and tries another number in this case to find the solution.
